=============================================

0.13: (last update: 18.2.2013)

  * Added cache/schedule
  * Made contact/email a required field to be able to send a report
    email on a revalidation failure.
  * Moved lat and lon to location/{lat,lon}
  * Made location and location/{lat,lon} required fields
  * The meaning of the status field has changed, it's now a compound
    object of all the fields that are related to the space status
  * Moved the fields open, lastchange and icon to status/{open,lastchange,icon}
  * Added the message field which was the former status field
  * Made the status icons non-required, because there's no app that
    is really using them and furthermore some spaces use them incorrectly
    because they (haven't|don't want) such icons.
  * Moved address to location/address
